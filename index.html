        <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I come from what you would call a non-tech background.
            I have a bachelors degree in International Business and my MBA from Oral Roberts University.
            I have always had a fascination with computers and technology, so when life gave me lemons I decided to make lemonade. 
            Thus beginning my career change and decision to take a leap of faith to learn more about web and app development.</p>

        <h1>Experience</h1>
            <p>My previous business career has given me the opportunity to be collaborative, creative, empathetic, and an active
    listener. Qualities and traits that I believe will translate well to become a great Junior Web Developer by being great at
    projects and building great relationships along my career.
    I am currently learning JavaScript with Code the Dream with the desire to start my new career in web development.
    My goal is to become a back end developer and learn Ruby after my current JavaScript boot camp.
